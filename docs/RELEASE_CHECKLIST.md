# Release Checklist

2048 Nova remains on the `0.9.0+1` release-candidate line. Automated checks below can verify repository behavior and build configuration; they do not replace physical-device, assistive-technology, signing, or store-distribution qualification.

## Automated release-candidate gate

Current objective evidence is recorded in `what_changed.md`.

- [x] `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed lib test`
- [x] `flutter analyze`
- [x] `flutter test --coverage`
- [x] `flutter build web --release`
- [x] Android release APK builds on the configured hosted runner
- [x] Linux release builds on the configured hosted runner
- [x] Windows release builds on the configured hosted runner
- [x] macOS release builds on the configured hosted runner
- [x] iOS release builds with `--no-codesign` on the configured hosted runner
- [x] Save-schema validation/migration and malformed-data recovery are regression tested
- [x] Daily Challenge persistence/history repair and replay-best preservation are regression tested
- [x] Undo lifetime-best and statistics-reset/Undo boundaries are regression tested
- [x] Board-size and positional tile accessibility semantics are regression tested
- [x] Terminal dialogs, replacement guards, keyboard shortcuts, and restored timed-game status are regression tested
- [x] External destination URI policy is regression tested

If production code changes after the evidence recorded in `what_changed.md`, repeat the affected automated gate before release.

## Manual device and interaction qualification

Complete these before promoting to `1.0.0`:

- [ ] Verify core moves, scoring, spawning, win/continue, and no-double-merge behavior through real interaction
- [ ] Verify save/resume across app termination and relaunch on representative devices
- [ ] Verify Undo through long sessions and after challenge transitions
- [ ] Verify Time Challenge and Move Limit behavior on representative devices
- [ ] Verify Daily Challenge across UTC date boundaries where practical
- [ ] Verify statistics and achievements during representative full-game sessions
- [ ] Verify light/dark/system themes, all palettes, and high-contrast switching
- [ ] Verify reduced-motion and platform animation-reduction behavior
- [ ] Verify touch/swipe controls on representative Android and iOS devices
- [ ] Verify keyboard focus, Arrow/WASD controls, H/U/P/Escape/R shortcuts, and window resizing on desktop/web
- [ ] Verify BMC, GitHub, LinkedIn, business/support email, and bug-report destinations using real platform handlers
- [ ] Verify responsive layout at representative small-phone, large-phone, tablet, landscape, desktop, and browser widths
- [ ] Verify native splash/icon presentation on representative targets
- [ ] Verify optional sound/haptic settings on platforms that support the corresponding feedback

## Accessibility qualification

- [ ] Verify board and tile announcements with TalkBack
- [ ] Verify board and tile announcements with VoiceOver
- [ ] Verify a representative desktop/browser screen reader
- [ ] Verify visible focus order and focus recovery around dialogs/navigation
- [ ] Verify large system text scaling without clipped primary controls
- [ ] Verify high contrast and non-color tile-value identification
- [ ] Verify timed challenge updates do not create disruptive repeated announcements

## Distribution and project hygiene

- [ ] Configure real Android distribution signing for the intended store/channel
- [ ] Configure Apple signing/provisioning for real iOS distribution
- [ ] Produce and inspect final store/package artifacts
- [ ] Confirm store privacy/data-safety metadata matches the offline-first implementation
- [ ] Prepare final screenshots/listing text where required
- [ ] Recheck README, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, version, release notes, and `what_changed.md`
- [ ] Confirm no credentials/private signing material are committed
- [ ] Review dependency/update state deliberately; do not upgrade blindly immediately before release
- [ ] Document any remaining known limitations
- [ ] Promote version/tag to `1.0.0` only after the stable-release criteria are satisfied
